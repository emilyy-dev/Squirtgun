/**
 * Squirtgun is a general-purpose, cross-platform Minecraft Java edition library,
 * designed to make plugin development a little easier. Originally known as LucyCommonLib,
 * named after the original author, it's now been updated beyond all recognition and is
 * slightly less crappy.
 *	<br />
 *	<br />
 * Squirtgun is designed to be platform-agnostic - if there's an implementation available
 * for a certain platform, your code will run on it. It makes use of popular libraries like
 * Kyori's Adventure to handle rich text. Everything else has been written to be simple and
 * similar to existing APIs while also being flexible and powerful. Also builders because
 * normal constructors are for boring people.
 * <br />
 * <br />
 * Squirtgun does have some quirks in its naming - who says API design has to be boring?
 * Support, whether for genuine help using this stuff or for relief from the trauma this
 * library will inevitably cause you, is available at
 * <a href="https://support.lucyy.me">https://support.lucyy.me</a>. on Discord.
